1. Vehicle and Derived Classes (Polymorphism)
This program demonstrates the concept of method overriding and polymorphism using a base class Vehicle and derived classes Car and Bike.
Base class Vehicle: Contains a method start().
Derived classes Car and Bike: Override the start() method to provide specific implementations.

2. Shape and Derived Classes - Area Calculation
This program demonstrates inheritance with a base class Shape and derived classes Circle, Rectangle, and Triangle. 
Base class Shape: Provides a common structure for all shapes.
Derived classes Circle, Rectangle, and Triangle: Each implements its own method to calculate the area.

3. Abstract Classes and Interfaces  
This program demonstrates the use of abstract classes and interfaces:
Abstract class Vehicle: Contains an abstract method start().
Interface Electric: Contains a method charge().
Classes Car and Bike: Extend Vehicle and implement Electric, providing specific implementations for start() and charge().
